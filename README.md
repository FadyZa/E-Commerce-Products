# E-commerce products ðŸ›’

Welcome to E-commerce products project! This responsive web application is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The primary objective of this project is to provide users with a visually appealing products page where they can view, add to cart, and customize products. Product data is fetched from the `data.json` file. The application includes an interactive and draggable cart that stores selected products in local storage. Additionally, users can customize the product card colors for a personalized experience.

## Features ðŸŒŸ

- **Product Display**: The webpage fetches product data from the `data.json` file and displays it in a visually appealing grid format.
